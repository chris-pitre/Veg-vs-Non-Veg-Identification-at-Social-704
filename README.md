# Classifying Veg vs Non-Veg food at Social 704

The problem we are aiming to solve is to use an image data source and a computer vision application in order to classify a given dish at Social 704 as vegetarian or non-vegetarian, and so help those with dietary restrictions identify the dish they are eating. For this project, a vegetarian dish is one that excludes meat and may or may not include animal by-products such as dairy and eggs, and is also non-vegan. A non-vegetarian dish is defined as all other dishes present. The input images will be limited by exclusively being from the Social 704 restaurant menu in order to prevent potential false positives and false negatives that may arise from different preparations and ingredients present of a similarly classed dish.
